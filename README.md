## 🚀 **Features**

### 🔐 **Secure Authentication**

* **Google Single Sign-On (OAuth 2.0)**
  Fast, secure login using a user's existing Google account.
* **Biometric Authentication**
  Supports fingerprint and facial recognition for quick and secure access.

### 🍎 **Food Search & Nutrition Lookup**

* Search thousands of foods
* View calories, macronutrients, vitamins & minerals
* Fast, clean UI for quick nutritional insights

### 🍽️ **Meal Plan Generation**

* Create daily or weekly meal plans
* Add foods to Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks
* Auto-calculates nutritional totals

### ⭐ **Favourites & Saved Foods**

* Save frequently used foods
* Quickly access items without searching again

### 🎨 **Clean and Responsive UI**

* Simple navigation
* High-contrast design
* Optimized for usability and accessibility

---

## 🧱 **Architecture Overview**

NutriFindApp follows a modular design consisting of:

### **Presentation Layer**

* UI pages, forms, navigation
* Biometric and Google login screens

### **Logic Layer**

* Authentication flow
* Meal plan generation
* Search filtering
* Nutrient calculations

### **Data Layer**

* Food models
* Meal plan data
* User session data
* Token storage

This structure makes the project easy to maintain, extend, and debug.

## 📚 **Data Structures Used**

NutriFindApp makes deliberate use of efficient data structures to support performance and usability.

### **`List<T>`**

Used for:

* Search results
* Meal plan entries
* Saved foods

**Why:**
Dynamic, easy to sort/filter, ideal for frequently changing data.

---

### **`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`**

Used for:

* Mapping nutrient names → values
* Fast retrieval of nutritional data

**Why:**
O(1) lookup time and better organization of nutrient sets.

---

### **Navigation Stack (Stack-like Behavior)**

Used for:

* Managing user navigation
* Handling the mobile “back” action

**Why:**
Mimics native mobile navigation flow.

---

### **Hierarchical Food Categories (Tree-like Structure)**

Although not implemented as raw binary trees, food categories follow a parent-child structure:

```
Food
 ├── Fruits
 │    ├── Citrus
 │    └── Berries
 ├── Vegetables
 ├── Proteins
 ├── Grains
```

**Why:**
Makes it easy to group foods and organize meal planning.

---

### **Hash-Based Security Structures**

Used in:

* Google OAuth token handling
* Biometric encrypted key storage

**Why:**
Ensures secure, tamper-resistant authentication.
